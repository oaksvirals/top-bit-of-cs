# The Odin Project: A Bit of Computer Science

This repo is for all projects under the "a bit of computer science" section of The Odin Project (TOP).

I've combined the following projects into this repo:

- Recursion
- Linked Lists
- Hash Maps
- Binary Search Trees

The final project for Knights Travails will be done in a separate standalone repo.

To use the code for the project change the script source in the head of the index.html.
